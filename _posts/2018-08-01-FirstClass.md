### Classes are objects too
In Pharo, creating a class is a bit different than other normal programming languages. In Java, for example, you would need to create a .java file and then type in the class code in that file. In Pharo, everything is an object, even classes. Here you will basically just create an object in memory that will contain the source code of the class.

### Let's just do it
To create a class in Pharo, just click anywhere in the background to open the World menu and select "System Browser".
![systembrowser]({{ "/assets/systembrowser.png" }})
On the top side of the System Browser there are 4 panes. The first shows the packages, the second shows the classes
