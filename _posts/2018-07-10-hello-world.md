## Who am I?
Just your regular "full stack" developer that switched to [Pharo](https://pharo.org/) as his main programming language. Before I used to do the Java dance. And JavaScript obviously, and convince Docker to run smoothly using bash.

### Wait, but why?
Mainly because [Feenk](https://feenk.com/) convinced me to join them. Am very glad they did! I really missed working for a startup. At Feenk, we use Pharo to create new tools for developers.

### No, why are you doing this, what's up with this blog?
Oh, because I want to document my learning experience in Pharo land. I'm hoping this will not only help others learn Pharo but also influence the development of Pharo itself.

### Isn't Pharo basically Smalltalk?
Yes, Pharo does come from Smalltalk, but Pharo is both the programming language and the environment. And it is actively maintained, and it has a great community - [pharo.org/community](https://pharo.org/community).

### Ok great, tell me more!
No. I mean yes, but next post. I'd like to keep posts quick to read. So this is it for now, bye!
